"""Verifies that internal links resolve, in two independent passes.

check_sources() scans every .qmd file for root-relative links and image
references (the '/images/...', '/files/...', and '/section/page.qmd'
paths produced by transform.py) and verifies each resolves to a real
file in the repo.

check_rendered_html() scans the rendered site under _site/ and verifies
that every same-origin href in the emitted HTML resolves to a real file
under _site/. The source check alone cannot catch a link that is
syntactically fine in the .qmd but has no rendered target -- e.g. an
extensionless href="/membership/index", which the source check happily
resolves to membership/index.qmd while the rendered page 404s.

External (http/https/mailto) links are not checked -- they're outside
this migration's control.
